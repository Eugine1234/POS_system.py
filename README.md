Pharmacy Point of Sale (POS) System
Project Overview
This project is a foundational implementation of a real-time Point of Sale (POS) system specifically designed to meet the unique operational needs of a pharmaceutical shop. It aims to streamline daily sales operations, manage inventory effectively, and lay the groundwork for regulatory compliance and efficient customer service in a pharmacy setting.

Developed with a focus on real-time data synchronization and a modular architecture, this system provides a robust platform for managing product sales, tracking stock levels, and enabling quick, accurate transactions. While this version demonstrates core functionalities, it's structured to be scalable and expandable for future enhancements, including advanced pharmacy-specific features.

Key Features
This system integrates several critical modules to ensure efficient pharmacy operations:

Real-time Sales & Transaction Processing:

Instant recording of sales, reflecting immediate changes in inventory and financial data.

Efficient processing of product sales with quantity and price calculations.

Immediate feedback on transaction success or failure, including insufficient stock alerts.

Basic Inventory Management:

Real-time stock level tracking for all products.

Ability to add new products with details like name, price, stock quantity, and optional expiry dates and batch numbers (crucial for pharmaceuticals).

Automatic stock deduction upon sale completion.

User-Friendly Interface (Web-based):

A simple, intuitive web interface for interacting with the POS system.

Easy entry for adding new products and processing sales.

Dynamic display of current product inventory.

Modular Backend Architecture:

A clean, API-driven backend using Flask, providing clear endpoints for data interaction.

Separation of concerns between database operations and application logic.

Lightweight Database Solution:

Utilizes SQLite for local, file-based data storage, making setup quick and easy for development and demonstration purposes.

How It Works (Architecture)
The system follows a classic client-server architecture:

Frontend (Client-Side):

Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Provides the graphical user interface (GUI) that users interact with.

Sends requests (e.g., "add product," "make sale") to the backend API.

Receives data from the backend and dynamically updates the display (e.g., product lists, messages).

Backend (Server-Side):

Built with Python and the Flask web framework.

Acts as the central processing unit, handling all business logic.

Receives requests from the frontend, processes them (e.g., calculates prices, updates stock).

Interacts directly with the database to store and retrieve information.

Exposes a RESTful API that the frontend consumes.

Database:

SQLite is used as the database management system.

Stores all persistent data, including product details, stock levels, and sales records.

Ensures data integrity and provides fast access for real-time operations.

The "real-time" aspect is achieved through the immediate processing of requests between the frontend and backend, and instant updates to the database, reflecting changes on the user interface almost instantaneously.

Technology Stack
Backend:

Python 3.x

Flask (Web Framework)

SQLite3 (Database)

Frontend:

HTML5

CSS3

Vanilla JavaScript

Development Environment:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Python Virtual Environments (venv)

Installation and Setup
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

Bash

[git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/Eugine1234/POS_system.py)
cd your-repo-name

Navigate to the Backend Directory:

Bash

cd backend
Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment:

Bash

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Backend Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Initialize the Database:

Bash

python database.py
This will create the pharmacy_pos.db file in your backend directory.

Run the Flask Backend Server:

Bash

python app.py
The server will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or http://localhost:5000). Keep this terminal window open.

Open the Frontend:
Navigate to the frontend directory in your file explorer or VS Code.
Open index.html in your web browser. For the best development experience, use a VS Code extension like "Live Server".

Usage
Once both the backend server is running and index.html is open in your browser:

Add New Products: Use the "Add New Product" section to register items in your inventory. Provide the product name, price, stock quantity, and optionally, an expiry date and batch number.

View Current Products: The "Current Products" section will display all products currently in your inventory, along with their IDs, prices, and stock levels. Click "Refresh Products" to update the list.

Make a Sale: Enter the Product ID (from the "Current Products" list) and the quantity you wish to sell. Click "Process Sale" to complete a transaction, which will update the product's stock in real-time.

Future Enhancements / Roadmap
This project serves as a solid foundation, and there are many avenues for future development to evolve it into a full-fledged, production-ready pharmacy POS system:

Advanced Pharmacy-Specific Features:

Prescription Management: Integration for electronic prescriptions (e-Rx), drug interaction checks, patient counseling documentation.

Controlled Substance Tracking: Robust logging and reporting for regulated medications.

Insurance Claims Processing: Integration with insurance providers for billing.

Batch & Expiry Management: Automated alerts for expiring products, FIFO (First-In, First-Out) stock rotation logic.

Enhanced POS Functionality:

Barcode Scanning Integration: For faster product lookup and checkout.

Multiple Payment Methods: Support for credit/debit cards, mobile payments, etc.

Returns & Exchanges: Workflow for processing product returns.

User Roles & Permissions: Different access levels for pharmacists, technicians, cashiers, and managers.

Customer Management (CRM): Patient profiles, loyalty programs, purchase history tracking.

Reporting & Analytics:

Comprehensive sales reports, inventory reports, and financial summaries.

Real-time dashboards for key performance indicators (KPIs).

Scalability & Robustness:

Migrate to a more powerful database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).

Implement robust error handling and logging.

Containerization (Docker) for easier deployment.

Secure user authentication (e.g., JWT).

Improved User Interface:

Transition to a modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Angular) for a more dynamic and responsive UI.

Better styling and user experience (UX).
